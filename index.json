Dubai left it in my country, the Philippines, until then. I kept using this pen because itâ€™s amazing and every time I write on it i feel very comfortable. The durability of this one is amazing and it rarely ran out of the pen. Every time I lost this pen, I always order it online\nWhile i use other pens, i still choose this pen because I\u0026rsquo;m used to it and how it looks so good, it\u0026rsquo;s even decent for drawing.\nI have no pictures of this pen in my house. Because I lost the pen at school again, I forgot to put it in my bag LMAOO ðŸ¤£\n","date":"February 10 2023","permalink":"/posts/why-i-love-this-pen/","section":"My Blog","summary":"everytime i lost this pen i always order it.","title":"Why i love Pilot Hightech point V7"},{"content":" Email # Discord: Himikaturu#7445 # Discord Server # Matrix: @kaizo:envs.net # Matrix Space\n","date":"August 23 2022","permalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"Email # Discord: Himikaturu#7445 # Discord Server # Matrix: @kaizo:envs.","title":"Contact"},{"content":"The creator of https://alisyus.xyz, Himikaturu. # Does not collect data, log IP addresses, or ask for any personally identifying or anonymous information.
